### Overview

The Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning algorithm uses a set of demonstrated trajectories D = {s,a} to imitate the expert's policy. It is inspired by the Generative Adversarial Network algorithm and by Inverse Reinforcement Learning algorithms.  

The agentâ€™s policy receives a state and acts in the environment, while a discriminator classifies the trajectories and provides a signal for the policy to learn. The goal is to generate a distribution that matches the expert distribution. In the originar paper the policy optimization step is done using TRPO, but in this implementation PPO is used.
